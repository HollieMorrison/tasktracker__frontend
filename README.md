# query our backend server and hit the superuser/tasks endpoint
# get bootstrap working correctly
# get react router working correctly
# create a task component
# render the tasks returned from endpoint

---

# how to login / register / auth with our server
# create ui for login / register / user profile
# using react-router for pages - setup the auth flow / user task area and auth restriction. 
# fetch / create / edit / delete tasks via signed in user.

# figure the auth strategy for react -> django server because both are
# now decoupled. before django rendered the frontend so exposed the authed user into the template wheras now our frontend only communicates via api calls. 
# possible chance of stateless or statefull auth.
